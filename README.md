Formed group for the assignment: Jason de Groot - a1740630,  Tom Galindo - a1720286 (Temporary Australians)

Initial problem discussion and plan:

Some initial thoughts on the problem:
- This is an optimisation problem
- There are too many possible solutions to be bruteforced; the potential solution space is very large
- Need to work out an efficient way to find a good solution (chances are it will be suboptimal)

We will start by having a read of the linked resources, just so we don't go too astray too early.
When we start designing, we will start by creating the easiest, most tractable solution that conforms to all constraints. This is so we can get on the scoreboard and have a solid/robust foundational algorithm and program.

We have around 3 weeks to complete this assignment. There are also a few other large assignments for other subjects all due at around the same time, so we are going to have to be quite smart with our time for this one because it seems complicated.
